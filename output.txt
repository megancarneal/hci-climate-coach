The Tek-species are special in the way that they have 20 % more levels than their vanilla counterparts. Once they are spawned and you can see their level, e.g. with the spyglass, this is the true wild level, which should also be the level that ASB will display. If Tek-creatures are spawned with admin-commands, the levels can be off, as VolatilePulse explained. So if you spawn a Tek creature with a level of 300, it will actually spawn with a level of 360. So most certainly the Tek Rex you posted first, actually has a wild level of 432. If it was spawned with an admin-command and not by the game, probably the special handling of the additional 20 % led to the confusion. In conclusion, the wild-level which ASB shows is the level you can see on the wild dino when it walks around. As soon as admin-commands like  are used, their true wild level is higher, and also ASB will show this higher level. I'm sorry that you feel offended by the additional questions. I can assure you it's not that we don't believe your statements, it's just that ARK handles some things in a way that is not obvious and we also don't know. Sometimes ARK has bugs which produces wrong values like the HP of Troodons, sometimes ARK just behaves strange, like with the levels of Tek species. To find out what is going on in ARK and how things can be fixed in ASB, we need as much information as possible, so some questions may seem not related to the initial question. In this case it's probably important how the creatures are spawned in, i.e. if they spawned naturally in the game or were spawned in by admin-commands. So I ask you to have some patience with additional questions, usually it helps to resolve issues faster the more informations are available. ",0,0.27988699645489323,0.45707482993197285,0,0,0.9689,n',

I'm currently doing some research on media streaming servers to integrate live streaming into Funkwhale, the project I'm working on. Ant media server looks like a really good pick for my use cases, but I'm not sure how to ensure viewers cannot hijack a stream. When creating a Stream in the interface, you can  Copy the RTMP publish url, like rtmp//localhost/LiveApp/499481361945988697107161,  being the Stream ID Copy the player embbed code, like ,  being the stream ID, the same one as in the publish URL  Since the Stream ID is used for publishing purposes, but also shared with viewers, my understanding is that any viewer can easily guess the publish URL by inspecting the player source and potentially hijack a stream. I may be completely wrong or missing something, but I'd like to double check that with you. Is this normal behaviour? Is there another way to achieve what I need (having a non guessable rmtp publishing link)? I can see that there is another issue linked to authentication ( but my idea was that providing a different, non guessable URL (with a different ID, but binded to the same stream) for viewing / publishing. Let me know if you need additional info, and thank you for the incredible work! ",1,0.9316078602186635,0.5395424836601307,0,0,0.9563,n',

I understand that people need to earn a living, hence the community/enterprise edition split. However, in most if not all projects, the community edition implement the core features that are absolutely mandatory, while the enterprise edition add extra features that are needed for more advanced use cases or bigger installations. The way I understand it, a basic media streaming server allows  One user to publish a stream Everyone to receive a stream  Item 1 is simply not available in the community edition, since everyone can actually publish on any stream. In some cases, additional security is an extra feature, but that's not true here having an even basic restriction on who can publish on a given stream is part of the core use case. Without that, the software is actually dangerous to use for any real-world stream! Let me take a concrete example showing how bad it could be. Alice has a video game a stream on an Ant Media Server (Community edition), with some young viewers in the audience. Alice's streams are completely safe for any audience. But one day, for fun, someone decides to hijack Alice's stream and broadcast porn instead. They can do that in literally 1 minute, by simply examining the Stream URL in the page source and firing up OBS. Alice looses her audience, reputation, and can even be sued by angry parents. Knowing that publishing is left completely open, I don't understand why anyone would use the Community edition of Ant Media. The attack surface and risks are just too big. I sincerely think publishing should be protected by default in the community edition, and I hope that you'll consider that for the safety of viewers and streamers on your platform.

Did you consider the security risks associated with the current state of your software? If all Community Edition deployments and Enterprise Edition streams that do not use the Token Control feature are vulnerable to stream hijacking, I believe you have a responsability to fix that. Your current stance is ""our software is insecure, but you can enable a paid option to make it secure"". And even when paying, the token thing is still optional! That's simply not acceptable, especially since you're not advertising this huge security risk anywhere. We're not talking about enhanced, nice-to-have security here (like with two-factor authentication which could be a paid option only), it's about basic, indispensable security for publishers and viewers! Thank you for the code samples, but there is no point in implementing a workaround to secure your software if you're not planning to secure it yourself in the end.

First of all Community edition provides more and more features even includes some enterprise features and used by lots of developers in the community. Using unique stream id both for streaming and playing is just about implementation example and you can manage other things on your application level based on this open-source project. I also gave an example about how you can change output name of streaming files that you will give to users. Therefore changing these names, users can not reach your stream (Alice's stream ) URL and you do not have any security threat at this point. To make it clear, One-time token implementation is developed for only limiting audience not for fixing a security issue. To sum up, Ant Media Server Community Edition is totally open source software and you can develop your application based on that, during these phases, you can change the structure, way of operation etc. Sure for them, you can get support, documentation etc every time.

It was just that the tone of your second and third post was quite unfriendly. Honestly, Contentify cannot reach the same high quality level as for example WordPress. WP has a huge community and lots of contributors plus a strong commercial background. None of these is true for Contentify. Therefore, it has no ads ad all, nowhere at all (except of some recommendations which do not generate any money). It does not spy on you or restrict you. DSVGO / GDPR...  If this really is something that interests you, let me ensure you, the only thing you have to worry about is the use of Google Analytics on the contentify.org website. That's the only ""evil"" third party software that is in use. And on our side, we do collect very (extremely?) few client data and we do very (rarely / almost none) analysis of the collected data. And ofcourse we do not sell / share any user data (not including Google Analytics). ",0,0.475010733428751,0.5471296296296297,0,0,0.7233,n',
