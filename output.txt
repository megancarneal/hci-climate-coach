It worked this way There was a parameter ""Allow to start a new campaign"" which was OFF by default. If you wanted to start a new campaign, you\'d set it to ON manually and then the menu would ask you if you wanted to make a new start. The reason behind this is to ease the administration of automatic server restarts when there is no administration instantly available. It also helped us a lot at the official server because users would just join the game and the progress would get loaded. I am not sure if the autoload is currently present in the mission.
