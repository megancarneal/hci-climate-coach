;It's actually a functionality which we have already implemented in the community version of Antistasi. It worked this way There was a parameter "Allow to start a new campaign" which was OFF by default. If you wanted to start a new campaign, you'd set it to ON manually and then the menu would ask you if you wanted to make a new start. The reason behind this is to ease the administration of automatic server restarts when there is no administration instantly available. It also helped us a lot at the official server because users would just join the game and the progress would get loaded. I am not sure if the autoload is currently present in the mission. ;It's actually a functionality which we have already implemented in the community version of Antistasi.

;ASB cannot know the wild level exactly, it uses a formula with the taming-effectiveness to determine it, and in most cases this is correct, sometimes it can be off by 1 level. The Tek-species are special in the way that they have 20 % more levels than their vanilla counterparts. Once they are spawned and you can see their level, e.g. with the spyglass, this is the true wild level, which should also be the level that ASB will display. If Tek-creatures are spawned with admin-commands, the levels can be off, as VolatilePulse explained. So if you spawn a Tek creature with a level of 300, it will actually spawn with a level of 360. So most certainly the Tek Rex you posted first, actually has a wild level of 432. If it was spawned with an admin-command and not by the game, probably the special handling of the additional 20 % led to the confusion. In conclusion, the wild-level which ASB shows is the level you can see on the wild dino when it walks around. As soon as admin-commands like  are used, their true wild level is higher, and also ASB will show this higher level. I'm sorry that you feel offended by the additional questions. I can assure you it's not that we don't believe your statements, it's just that ARK handles some things in a way that is not obvious and we also don't know. Sometimes ARK has bugs which produces wrong values like the HP of Troodons, sometimes ARK just behaves strange, like with the levels of Tek species. To find out what is going on in ARK and how things can be fixed in ASB, we need as much information as possible, so some questions may seem not related to the initial question. In this case it's probably important how the creatures are spawned in, i.e. if they spawned naturally in the game or were spawned in by admin-commands. So I ask you to have some patience with additional questions, usually it helps to resolve issues faster the more informations are available. ;ASB cannot know the wild level exactly, it uses a formula with the taming-effectiveness to determine it, and in most cases this is correct, sometimes it can be off by 1 level.

To find out what is going on in ARK and how things can be fixed in ASB, we need as much information as possible, so some questions may seem not related to the initial question. In this case it's probably important how the creatures are spawned in, i.e. if they spawned naturally in the game or were spawned in by admin-commands. So I ask you to have some patience with additional questions, usually it helps to resolve issues faster the more informations are available.;n;0.08164449;0.08164449;0.12081632653061229;0.27988699645489323;0.9689

;Hi there, I don't know if it's the proper place to ask this kind of questions, let me know if you'd rather have this published somewhere else. I'm currently doing some research on media streaming servers to integrate live streaming into Funkwhale, the project I'm working on. Ant media server looks like a really good pick for my use cases, but I'm not sure how to ensure viewers cannot hijack a stream. When creating a Stream in the interface, you can  Copy the RTMP publish url, like rtmp//localhost/LiveApp/499481361945988697107161,  being the Stream ID Copy the player embbed code, like ,  being the stream ID, the same one as in the publish URL  Since the Stream ID is used for publishing purposes, but also shared with viewers, my understanding is that any viewer can easily guess the publish URL by inspecting the player source and potentially hijack a stream. I may be completely wrong or missing something, but I'd like to double check that with you. Is this normal behaviour? Is there another way to achieve what I need (having a non guessable rmtp publishing link)? I can see that there is another issue linked to authentication ( but my idea was that providing a different, non guessable URL (with a different ID, but binded to the same stream) for viewing / publishing.

;@friend thanks for the feedback. I should correct some points because it causes some misunderstandings. First of all Community edition provides more and more features even includes some enterprise features and used by lots of developers in the community. Using unique stream id both for streaming and playing is just about implementation example and you can manage other things on your application level based on this open-source project. I also gave an example about how you can change output name of streaming files that you will give to users. Therefore changing these names, users can not reach your stream (Alice's stream ) URL and you do not have any security threat at this point. To make it clear, One-time token implementation is developed for only limiting audience not for fixing a security issue. To sum up, Ant Media Server Community Edition is totally open source software and you can develop your application based on that, during these phases, you can change the structure, way of operation etc. Sure for them, you can get support, documentation etc every time. ;@friend thanks for the feedback.

Even if it broke, it wouldn't be long before someone noticed and either reverted or corrected it. Even with a release, there's always a chance bugs make it through. If we versioned ELI and effectivly did a new patch release after each PR, would that release process give any more QA over the regular PR merge process? That's a fair point, I hadn't considered schema changes. I guess for that we would need semantic versioning. Perhaps we could build this into the PR process, so that we do new patch releases for each PR which we want to go through to iD straight away? ;If we worked to improve the testing, do you think we could ever reach a point where it's good enough to feed straight into iD?

;I feel like you are not even listening to me.  This project doesn't have a version number.  It has a robot that just runs  for people who forget to do it themselves.  The robot introduces conflicts when people actually do run make. It's a ruby script that runs make in a Travis hook to smoosh together JSON files with python.  ELI might just be the hackiest nonsense I've ever seen.  This is not how reliable software is built.  "Adding more checks" is missing the point.  Anyone with osmlab rights could just delete all the files.  That we could "fix it quickly" is also missing the point.  I'm sure I'd be the person responsible for fixing it quickly. We will never take the autogenerated output on the master development branch of ELI and push it directly into iD.  Never ever.  Stop asking.

;@friend, thanks for helping to make Electron better and especially the detailed bug report. You've made it very clear that this issue being fixed is important to you. Open source is tricky, and I understand that relying heavily on a project like Electron can be scary, frustrating, and confusing. We do not want to break anyones apps. None of the maintainers want that. We even run a program to help ensure we fix participating app's major issues during our beta cycle. However, because of the Electron maintainers' limited time and resources, we can't get to everything immediately and some things we can't get to for an extended period. This is common in open source projects. Repeatedly commenting with no new information and "shouting" at the development team by using all caps is not something we do here. Moving forward, I would recommend reading and following the advice in Creators, contributors, and collaborators. Just to be clear, you are welcome to continue participating in the following ways  submitting bug reports with enough detail to reproduce - ideally a Fiddle example a new feature request with context logistical questions that may not be covered in the docs (e.g. asking about release timelines in a polite way)  Including additional comments in all caps or responding repeatedly with requests of the maintainer team are off-topic and will result in those issues being closed immediately. Please follow the next step exactly Let's all take a moment to digest the above. Please do not interact with the project for 24-hours. No comments, new issues, or pull-requests. After that, please look through your open issues and edit them to ensure they're entirely on-topic, and we can continue the discussion here about the best way to engage going forward. ;@friend, thanks for helping to make Electron better and especially the detailed bug report.

;I think this is the better approach. Because making some default credentials and a lot of users will never change them. Make them forced to change the password bu the default account name will be the same everywhere and bad guy will have no pain to bruteforce weak password. It's maybe more work do make authentication optional but it seems more secure than providing default credentials. And this will be cleaner. ;I think this is the better approach.

;I think the bigger point here would be to create the option. To each his own on CHOOSING their level of security. Setting a responsible default, is on the developer to "do security right", but creating the options that the users are looking for, is on the developer to "create good/flexible software". In this case, many of us are using some other mechanism to restrict access - or some don't want auth, period. Anyone making these decisions takes the risk balance into their own hands when changing from the responsible default setting. It's sort of like saying Windows shouldn't have an option to disable a password authentication to the machine. But there are use cases that dictate or necessitate the need of such a practice. In my scenario, I'm using nginx to redirect to an auth server/service before anyone gains access to anything on the domain. So DNS rebinding is not an issue in this case, and auth is not a security issue as I've setup a different auth. For me, I'd to access this service without ANOTHER login required, even if it is typing admin with no password. The user experience is undesirable.

;Sometimes my Arduino freezes or crashes when using JEFF ROWBERG library to read DMP data from MPU6050. It took me almost a full year to discover the problem and today I had some spare time and I tried to find where exactly arduino hangs/freezes. I discovered it is usually when executin getFIFOCount() or getIntStatus(). I discovered that inserting many Serial.print with tags along my entire code so I could know exactly which line hanged. So I discovered everytime my arduino hanged/freezes it was at a line with getFIFOCount() or getIntStatus(). So I decided to take a close look at it. Inside the file MPU6050.cpp there is a code like this uint16_t MPU6050getFIFOCount() {     I2CdevreadBytes(devAddr, MPU6050_RA_FIFO_COUNTH, 2, buffer)      return (((uint16_t)buffer[0]) &lt &lt  8) | buffer[1]  } I checked the function "readBytes()" inside I2Cdev.cpp and I found this I2CdevreadBytes(uint8_t devAddr, uint8_t regAddr, uint8_t length, uint8_t *data, uint16_t timeout) You see the problem? The function readBytes accepts one last parameter which is "timeout" but the function getFIFOCount uses readBytes without the timeout parameter! That's probably a bug cause sometimes I think the readBytes takes too long to execute and a TIMEOUT SHOULD BE set to avoid the function hanging out forever. I am pretty sure maaaany MAAAANY other people alterady experienced this problem and spent a lot of time trying to understand what went wrong. Some people mistakenly believe it's related to bufffer overflow in the FIFO or because of some non optimized code. It could be the problem but MY PROBLEM FOR ALMOST A FULL YEAR has been this bug reported here. I really hope someone fix this and add a timeout so nobody would spent entire months anymore seeking a problem that's is really hard to track an intermitent. ;Sometimes my Arduino freezes or crashes when using JEFF ROWBERG library to read DMP data from MPU6050.

;Do you use mag?　I use the HMC5883L with mpu6050 to read the mag raw data and read the pitch yaw roll by DMP is fine. But when I use the mpu9150 to read the the mag data by DMP only , it keeps overflow and  freezes soon.

;@friend, please try to avoid sensationalist language with unsubstantiated claims. Yes, I am reasonably certain that the I2Cdev core and especially some of the device libraries are not bug-free. However, they have worked remarkably well with very few changes for literally thousands of people, some of whom have come back to tell me so after the fact (with complete, stable, working project demos). As noted in my comment from June 28, I2Cdev core code itself does not contain any loops that could lock up the whole system. The Wire library, however, does. This is well-documented and tracked separately. It is not something that I2Cdevlib code can fix, other than switching to a different I2C implementation (which is not a bad idea, but it is outside the scope of this bug report). I still contend that I2Cdev core communication works correctly as long as the hardware is electrically reliable. If the hardware is not electrically reliable, the CPU freeze is because of the Wire library, which has a blocking  loop and no timeout as documented in Arduino issue #1476. I have taken the example code that you posted on June 28 and run it with no modifications in the following setup  Arduino IDE v1.6.11 I2Cdevlib repo pulled from latest Github master branch Official Arduino Uno R3 GY521 breakout board for MPU-6050 AD0 pin tied to Arduino GND VCC pin to Arduino 5V (GY-521 has 3.3v regulator on board) SDA/SCL pins connected to Arduino SDA/SCL correctly Saleae Logic analyzer monitoring SDA and SCL   Your sketch compiles and flashes correctly. The DMP initialization completes without issue, and the YPR output settles within a few seconds to a stable value. I have left it running for 15 minutes with no problems. It has remained totally stable with no freezes, FIFO overflows, or other problems. To test, I pulled out the SCL wire to simulate an electrical issue. This (at least this time) caused the SDA line to get stuck low  The I2Cdev core is not doing this inside its own abstraction code. The GY-521 has 2.2k pull-up resistors on the SDA/SCL lines, so something is driving SDA low during a read operation from the Arduino side. Reconnecting the SCL wire does not resume normal operation, even with all zero data coming back. This suggests that the Wire library got stuck in its blocking  loop while the MPU-6050 sensor is holding SDA low waiting for more clock pulses, which won't come because the Wire library is stuck. (Maybe. I haven't dug into the Wire library's guts.) But the main point here is that it worked perfectly until I broke the hardware on purpose. I will reset the Arduino and let it run for another long while just to confirm this (expected) behavior. ;@friend, please try to avoid sensationalist language with unsubstantiated claims.

;Thanks jeff and I didnt want to offend you. No. I appreciate your help, but I think it would be smart to let people know that your library sometimes crashes. Yes, I executed this same code many times with no problem. But sometimes when I just add some lines of code it gets completely unstable, and after a while it does not generate any other problem. Jeff, I dont have bad wiring, this is not my case. The wires are very well connected to arduino.  I realized this bug happens when you call mpu.getFIFOCount() too many times in small time frame. It almost always freezes at mpu.getFIFOCount() (right when it gets executed). I know that for a fact cause I puted serial.println before and after that function, and it freezes the only the first serial.println. You library may work fine in a moment, in another it just does not work. Adding some lines make the code break sometimes, and other times dont (there is no conflict between your code and those new lines). Jeff, I appreciate your attention and efforts into this library but something is not right. Maybe you are right and it's bad wiring, but in my case it surelly is not. I tested this setup in other arduinos and got similar results. I dont know if you ever heard of SEBRAE here in Brazil. It's an education institution "for free", with small fees. I know at least 2 good friends which are teachers of this institution in electronics and also confirmed the problem I was facing. It was them who made me come here and report this. I tried to report this problem in many different foruns and in almost all cases, in the middle of the thread, other people confirmed what I said and had the same problem with different setups. If you think this problem happens of because of some lines of I2C getting LOW, why cant you setup and interrupt in your code to check if the line is LOW for too long and maybe reset the device it that timeout happens? I never used an original arduino, I always used clones, maybe some poor build in those clones cause this problem? Sorry if I disrespected you, you are a nice guy who devoted lots of time to this library however I think, IMHO, that it's not safe using your library in quadcopters, robotic arms... someone could get seriously hurt. ;Thanks jeff and I didnt want to offend you.

;@friend I don't think you are quite getting the point Jeff is making. The problem is not with his library, but with the Arduino Wire library itself that is part of the Arduino IDE. More specifically it is the two-wire interface (TWI) library that the Wire library calls to handle I2C communications. I stumbled upon this discussion looking for an alternative implementation of an I2C library for a unrelated device I am using and can confirm that any device that calls the Wire library will suffer the same issue you are talking about. While loops are used in the TWI library for communication, and as a result, the code can block all other functions on the Arduino while it is waiting infinitely in the TWI while loop. Jeff demonstrated the infinite loop by pulling out the SCL wire from his hardware. Internally, the TWI library provided by Arduino waits for a response from the sensor that is never coming because the physical wire is removed. While your friends at SEBRAE confirmed the behavior, like you they have wrongly assumed it is due to Jeff's code. If you took a different I2C sensor with a library written by a different person (such as the one for the sensor I am using) and pulled a wire, it would behave the exact same way. As for why can't Jeff put an interrupt in his code to check if the line is LOW for too long, the library is blocking anything from happening (Which is why everything stops). The Arduino environment is not a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The issue is outside Jeff's code. I hope this clarifies the issue. ;@friend I don't think you are quite getting the point Jeff is making.

;@friend Thanks for your response. I hope that no offence was taken. The issue I am having is actually related to the BME280, a distant relative of the BMP180 sensor, and communications via TCP/IP. My hardware and project is quite different from what you are discussing, and I do not use the MPU6050. From my quick Google search it sounds like the sensor does a lot, and making it work with other I2C hardware is tricky. I wanted to offer some feedback only because I noticed the strong language in your reply to Jeff. I did a quick test with my project, in which the BME280 is the only device communicating via I2C. My microprocessor is an ESP8266 (Which is quite a bit faster than the Uno) and I am using a common industrial protocol over TCP/IP. I have some software that is polling the ESP8266 every second, and I am actively debugging using the serial interface, so there is additional work being done by the system. I pulled one of the wires, and the system kept working. I put the wire back, still no problems. I tried this a couple more times, randomly, and finally the system stopped working. I am only asking for one value via I2C and one value over the industrial communication channel, so I would guess that if I increased the amount of data through the different interfaces, the problem might start to happen more often. Anyways, I hope that you can find a solution to the problem you are having. I thought I would share what I have experienced. Take care! ;@friend Thanks for your response.

Someone added a fixed delay after wire operation in the readbyte call that was slowing down the I2C accesses.

If you print something, maybe you should print one character and only use one debug statement at a time until you get Jtag emulator. Also remember you have multiple FIFO in the pipe and it may be getting confused dealing with its threshold setting. I2C controller FIFO, Accelerometer FIFO. Do both generate interrupt? If so disable one and use different method of hand shaking. ;I helped someone fix the issue with the same setup using the Arduino 101 libraries and fixed the performance issue in the same area that you are having problem.

;@friend actually what you are saying is very true! If I dont call too frequently FIFO functions (or retrieve data) this problem does not happen, so your solution to add a delay will certainly help IF, AND ONLY IF, this delay is not too high which could cause the fifo overflow. This "bug" relies in the fact that if you request data too fast using I2C something will get wrong at some time and will freeze arduino. And what is really really strange is that sometimes when arduino freezes the watchdog fires, and sometimes not. I use watchdog to turn off my quad if arduino is not working for 500ms but sometimes arduino freezes and watchdog does not even fire. ;@friend actually what you are saying is very true!

;Hi all, Well... I use Jeff's library together with the NRF24L01 Radio 2.4GHz transceiver library on an Arduino UNO. The idea is to read data from the MPU6050 and then transmit it for further processing by a nearby computer. My problem with that was that I would, like most of you, see the arduino freeze after some seconds. The chances of getting the problem was somehow correlated with the use of the serial print, but not just that in my case! I work on an university robotic lab, thus I have permission to use multiples arduino boards. One day, trying to debug the problem, I noticed that the code would run normally on some arduino board (not freeze) and not in others. I had those made in Italy and those made in China.. It turns out, only the Italian ones work.  If I upload the same code on the Chinese boards it doesn't work! So, I assume, there must be some hardware incompatibilities issues with the library. In summary, I removed all calls to serial print inside the arduino loop function and use only Italian made boards. In the receiver code (arduino connected to the computer), I use the jeff's library with ros, in order to read the transmitted data from the serial port. It works for me! The only thing now is that I want to receive data at 100Hz, now I receive at about 48Hz. Maybe, the @friend tip on playing with TWBR may also work. Let's see! ;Hi all, Well...

;@friend Not at all. I bought two units from Drotek -- both exhibit the same behaviour... much to my dismay. No, not really. MPU6050 latching SDA low is a violation of I²C protocol. Thus, this means undefined behaviour for the library. It really is up to you -- as system engineer -- to handle such situations. There is no universal way to unlatch such a chip although a common technique is disabling I²C, sending 9 clock cycles over SCL pin (as a GPIO) and reenabling I²C mode if SDA unlatches. (Or resetting the offending chip, if possible.) Regarding, the situation with Wire -- it would certainly be nice if it could detect a SDA latch condition as it currently just freezes preventing further handling. This is in fact an oft requested feature. Of course, this requires use of a Timer which is a precious resource on an Arduino. Either way, in my humble opinion, the only correct way for Wire to go about it -- if it were to implement timeouts -- return an error, and let the designer handle it. @friend may (or may not) then choose to implement quirky chip handling, but currently his hand are tied.

;Issue description react-popper is a dependency of reactstrap, which I am attempting to use in s SharePoint Framework project.  SharePoint Framework (SPFx) uses webpack extensively, and react-popper is causing webpack warnings which in turn lead to component load failures because react-popper has not been properly included in the output. Discussion of this issue is linked to an open issue in the SharePoint Dev Docs repository, and while the original issue was thought to be a fault in upgrading SPFx to use React 16, investigation has indicated an issue specifically with react-popper - see sp-dev-docs issue 1315. CodePen demo This is a build issue specific to use of react-popper in conjunction with other frameworks and cannot be reproduced in CodePen alone. Steps to reproduce the problem  Create a new SharePoint Framework solution as per the standard guidelines a. Install gulp and the yeoman generator for SPFx  b. Create a new SPFx Web Part  , accept all defaults Update the  file to use React 16 and  Add bootstrap, jquery, reactstrap a. Note that recently released reactstrap@friend.0.0 uses react-popper@friend.8.3 Add any reactstrap component to the SPFx solution Build and deploy per standard processes  a.   b.   c.  Deploy per standard SharePoint Processes Attempt to load the Web Part in a SharePoint Modern Experience page.  What is the expected behavior? It is expected that no warnings will be issued by webpack, and that the component will load correctly. What went wrong? Webpack issues the following warnings during the bundle phase Warning - [webpack] 'dist' ./node_modules/react-popper/lib/Popper.js There are multiple modules with names that only differ in casing.
